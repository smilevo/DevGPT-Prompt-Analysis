# Expansive Insights: Analyzing Developer-ChatGPT Interactions

## Overview
This capstone project focuses on the interaction between developers and ChatGPT, analyzing various aspects of these interactions. Our study aims to provide insights into the nature of software engineers' queries, and delves deeper into multi-turn conversation.

## Contents
1. **Notebook**: Contains all the code and analysis conducted for this project.
2. **Data Set (Initial Preprocessing)**: The datasets "RQ1.xlsx" and "RQ2.xlsx" include the annotated data for research question 1 and 2 respectively.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Before diving into the notebook, make sure you have the following libraries and tools installed:
- pandas
- langdetect
- numpy

You can download the raw data from the following links:
1. [**DevGPT Dataset**](https://github.com/NAIST-SE/DevGPT)
2. [**Kaggle 89k-ChatGPT-Conversations Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noahpersaud/89k-chatgpt-conversations)

### Installation
If you don't have these libraries installed, you can typically install them using pip or conda, for example:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib langdetect numpy
```

## Running the Notebook
To run the notebook successfully, follow these steps:

- Open the notebook file in your preferred Python environment.
- Execute the cells sequentially to perform data processing.

Feel free to experiment with the code and analyses to further explore the developer-ChatGPT interactions.
